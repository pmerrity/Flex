<p>The grid is light and simple to master! There are 4 classes you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>.row -- A wrapper that is clearfix ready (prevents collapsing when children are floated).</li>
<li>.col-# -- Replace &quot;#&quot; with a number 1 - 24 to determine number of columns it spans. (i.e. col-24 = 100%)</li>
<li>.no-float -- Overrides the &quot;float: left&quot; property in each .col-# class. Use with .auto-margin</li>
<li>.auto-margin -- Makes an element block-level and centers it within the parent. Example: maybe you want an element to be 50%, but  centered instead of to the left</li>
</ul>
