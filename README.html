<h1 id="flex-1-1-0-">Flex (1.1.0)</h1>
<p>Flex is a responsive grid system. It is based on a 24-column grid system and contains standard media query breakpoints for mobile (480px), tablet (768px), and desktop (992px) so you don&#39;t have to worry about it!</p>
<h3 id="what-s-new-v1-1-0-">What&#39;s New? (v1.1.0)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adding border-box box-sizing to the columns, and everything within them will inherit the CSS property. No more hassle with borders and padding!</li>
<li>Changed the weird &quot;.col-4p8&quot; to &quot;.col-4-8&quot;.</li>
<li>Updated the breakspoints by 1px to break properly.</li>
<li>New things! Added padding classes to throw some quick.</li>
<li>More Sarcasm!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-should-i-use-this-">Why Should I Use This?</h3>
<p>Because most frameworks are a piece of poo. Nobody wants 500MB worth of useless junk added to their nifty site! Unless that&#39;s your thing...I use this for all of most of my projects, templating, and various client sites because I don&#39;t need 500MB crappy framework files that slow down my site.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="how-u-use-it-">hOw U uSe It?!!?/</h3>
<p>The grid is light and simple to master! There are a number of classes you can use (not a million):</p>
<ul>
<li>.row -- A wrapper that is clearfix ready (prevents collapsing when children are floated).</li>
<li>.col-{#} -- Replace {#} with a number 1 - 24 to determine number of columns it spans. (i.e. col-24 = 100%).</li>
<li>.no-float -- Overrides the &quot;float: left&quot; property in each .col-# class. Use with .auto-margin</li>
<li>.auto-margin -- Makes an element block-level and centers it within the parent. Example: maybe you want an element to be 50%, but  centered instead of to the left.</li>
<li>.pull-right -- Columns float left by default. Want it on the right? Use this.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="new-">New!</h5>
<ul>
<li>.pad-{size} -- This standard padding is simple. Want a teeny bit of padding? Just add .pad-xs to any class and voila! 5px padding all around. Available sizes: xxs, xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl (5px, 10px, 20px, 40px, 80px, 120px 180px respectively).</li>
<li>.pad-{direction}-{size} -- Similar to the top, but the if you want it to only go horizontal or vertical, just add &quot;horiz&quot; or &quot;vert&quot; (i.e. .pad-vert-sm = padding: 10px 0px).</li>
</ul>
